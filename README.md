# Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression

This project compares the performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models on two different datasets:
1. **MNIST dataset** - A dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Penguin dataset** - A dataset containing measurements of penguin species.

The goal is to analyze and compare how each model performs on image data (MNIST) and a tabular dataset (Penguin), evaluating their effectiveness on classification tasks.
